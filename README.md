# Godot v4.0 game template

This project is still in progress and more features/improvements are coming. Feel free to open issues as well as pull requests.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide an easy-to-use and pretty much configurable Godot v4.0 game template so that while developing a game, we can be focused on just that: the game.

Some of the features this template offers are:
- Internalization: An easy manner of translating the game's text.
- Sound effects and music manager.
- Global timer that makes easy the way we create timers.
- Game settings loader.
- Various game-independent scenes like credits screen, splash screen, main menu, pause menu, and more.

## How to use it

- Clone the repository or generate a new one by [using this template](https://github.com/tsarquis88/godot-game-template/generate).
- Put your game into the [Playable scene](https://github.com/tsarquis88/godot-game-template/tree/main/Playable). While this is a game-specific scene (that meaning you can and you should modify it), it should maintain the way it communicates with its parent ([Playground](https://github.com/tsarquis88/godot-game-template/tree/main/Template/Playground/)) scene, to handle the game's endings, the pause menu, and other stuff that are taken care of by the template.
